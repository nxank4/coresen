Feynman AI, inspired by the legendary physicist Richard Feynman, is at the cutting edge of scientific discovery. By leveraging artificial intelligence to uncover symbolic relationships in data, Feynman AI empowers researchers to automate complex reasoning processes and accelerate breakthroughs across disciplines.

## What is Feynman AI?

Feynman AI is an advanced platform for symbolic regression, a powerful AI technique that identifies mathematical expressions to describe relationships within data. Unlike traditional machine learning models, which often function as black boxes, symbolic regression provides interpretable solutions, making it particularly valuable for scientific applications.

### Key Features of Feynman AI:

1. **Symbolic Regression**: Uncover clear, interpretable mathematical formulas from raw data.
2. **Automated Reasoning**: Analyze relationships within datasets without manual intervention.
3. **Cross-Disciplinary Applications**: Solve problems in physics, biology, engineering, and more.
